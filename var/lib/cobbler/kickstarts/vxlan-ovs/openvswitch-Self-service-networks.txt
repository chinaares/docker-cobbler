Open vSwitch mechanism driver
 
UPDATED: 2017-08-02 12:57
The Open vSwitch (OVS) mechanism driver uses a combination of OVS and Linux bridges as interconnection devices. However, optionally enabling the OVS native implementation of security groups removes the dependency on Linux bridges.

We recommend using Open vSwitch version 2.4 or higher. Optional features may require a higher minimum version.
